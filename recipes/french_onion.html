    <h3>Mix Breads crumps and dry soup mix together in a bowl</h3>
    <p>For as simple as this recipe was, it was pretty tasty. Dont fear the mayo-you cannot taste it!</p>
    <p>The only change I made was to slighly pulse the onion soup mix in my food processor to get even texture</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup bread crumps</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry french onion soup mix</li>
        <li>1/3 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste (optional)</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumps and dry soup mix together in a bowl</li>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise and garlic paste together in a separate bowl</li>
        <li>Brush chicken breasts with the mayonnaise mixture</li>
        <li>Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 20 minutes</li>
    </ol>
